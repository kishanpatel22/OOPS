\section{Destructor}

A \emph{Destructor} is a special member function used for destroying or
deleting the object instance.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Destructor is special member function having same name as that of 
          class preceded by a tilde symbol. 
    \item Destructor do not have any return type and doesn't take any arguments.
    \item Destructor is automatically called we the object goes out of scope.
    \item C++ complier automatically generates a default destructor for the 
          class, however in case of \texttt{dynamically allocated memory} by the 
          class object, user defined destructor must take care about the
          \texttt{memory leaks}.
